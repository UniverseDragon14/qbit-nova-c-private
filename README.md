[![QBIT NOVA CI](https://github.com/UniverseDragon14/qbit-nova-c/actions/workflows/qbit-nova-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/UniverseDragon14/qbit-nova-c/actions/workflows/qbit-nova-ci.yml)


Creator and owner: **Universal Dragon Aslam**

Product brand: **Novakutty**

Core technology: **QBIT NOVA C**

User-facing assistant identity: **NOVA / EVE**

Creator provenance: [Universal Dragon Aslam Receipt](docs/UNIVERSAL_DRAGON_ASLAM_RECEIPT.md)

QBIT NOVA C is a small C-based quantum-style language, bytecode VM, state-vector simulator, and virtual QMSG/QCPU layer.

Important safety note:
QBIT NOVA C does not claim that a normal phone or Raspberry Pi processor becomes a physical quantum chip.
It builds a software virtual quantum processor layer on top of classical hardware.

## Novakutty Build Week Judge Quickstart

Novakutty is Universal Dragon Aslam's **Developer Tool**, powered by QBIT NOVA
C: an approval-first C runtime that admits safe workloads, rejects unsafe
workloads, and executes verified quantum-style work through a software Virtual
QCPU.

NOVA / EVE is the Novakutty product's user-facing assistance identity. This
Stage 2B release proves the runtime bridge and safety boundary; it does not yet
claim that an EVE model-inference backend is implemented.

Planned identity roles:

- **NOVA** presents approval decisions, runtime state, and proof evidence.
- **EVE** explains those results conversationally and suggests safe next steps.
- Neither identity may bypass the approval gate or claim physical quantum
  hardware.

Run the one-command judge demo on Linux:

```bash
bash scripts/qnova_build_week_demo.sh
```

Expected final marker:

```text
PASS: NOVAKUTTY_BUILD_WEEK_DEMO_READY
```

The demo exercises the approval gate, the v4.7 userspace frontend, the v4.6
`qcpud` Unix-socket backend, STATUS and GHZ requests, Q32.32 conversion,
bounded timeout recovery, and cleanup. It performs no root, kernel-module,
device-node, TCP/UDP, GPIO, or physical-QPU action.

### Ownership and required development-tool disclosure

Novakutty and QBIT NOVA C are conceived, directed, and owned by Universal
Dragon Aslam. For Build Week transparency, Codex assisted with repository
inspection, the bounded Stage 2B adapter, focused tests, and documentation; it
is not presented as the creator or owner. Exact GPT-5.6 usage and the required
`/feedback` Session ID must be verified before submission—no unsupported model
claim is made.

The creator identity and CI-recovery milestone were already recorded in the
v4.1.2 Universal Dragon Aslam Receipt before this Build Week submission work.

See [the OpenAI Build Week guide](OPENAI_BUILD_WEEK.md) for judging
context, supported platforms, the required assistance disclosure, and the
items that must be finalized before submission. See
[the Stage 2B design](docs/QCPU_V47_STAGE2B_QCPUD_ADAPTER.md) for the adapter
contract and focused proof. The
[Devpost submission draft](DEVPOST_SUBMISSION_DRAFT.md) contains copy-ready
form answers and the demo voiceover.

## OpenQASM Export

Build exporter:

    gcc src/tools/qasm_export.c \
        src/lexer/lexer.c \
        src/parser/parser.c \
        src/compiler/compiler.c \
        -o qnova-qasm -lm

Run:

    ./qnova-qasm examples/bell_qasm.qn

Expected output includes:

    OPENQASM 3.0;
    include "stdgates.inc";
    qubit[2] q;
    bit[2] c;
    h q[0];
    cx q[0], q[1];
    c[0] = measure q[0];
    c[1] = measure q[1];


## Bell State Proof

Run:

    ./scripts/proof_bell.sh 20

Expected result:

    Only |00> and |11> appeared.

This proves the QBIT NOVA state-vector engine preserves Bell-state measurement correlation.


## v2.0 Release Checkpoint

QBIT NOVA C v2.0 is the first public release checkpoint.

It includes:

- Public release notes
- Changelog
- v2 architecture documentation
- Quick demo documentation
- Demo script
- Bell-state proof
- OpenQASM export
- QMSG virtual qbit register
- CI proof tests

Run:

    ./scripts/demo.sh
    ./scripts/test_all.sh

v2.0 keeps the safety boundary clear: this is a software virtual quantum processor layer, not physical quantum hardware conversion.
\n| v2.0 | Public release checkpoint |\n| v2.1 | QASM file export bridge |\n| v2.2 | Virtual QCPU boot layer |\n| v2.3 | NOVA Hypercube Runtime status layer |\n| v2.4 | NOVA Hypercube snapshot report |\n

## QASM File Export

Run:

    ./scripts/export_qasm.sh examples/bell_qasm.qn build/bell.qasm

This creates:

    build/bell.qasm

The exported file can be used later as the bridge toward Qiskit or real quantum cloud workflows.


## Virtual QCPU Boot

Run:

    ./scripts/qcpu_boot.sh

This creates a local virtual QCPU session:

    .qcpu/session.env
    build/qcpu_node.json
    build/bell.qasm

This does not convert local hardware into physical quantum hardware.
It creates a QBIT NOVA software runtime identity layer on top of classical hardware.


## NOVA Hypercube Runtime

Run:

    ./scripts/hypercube_status.sh

This verifies the local NOVA Hypercube Runtime identity using the existing virtual QCPU boot layer.

It checks:

- QCPU node identity
- QCPU session file
- QASM export file
- software safety boundary

This is a software-defined quantum-style runtime layer, not physical quantum hardware.


## NOVA Hypercube Snapshot

Run:

    ./scripts/hypercube_snapshot.sh

This creates:

    build/hypercube_snapshot.md

The snapshot records QCPU node identity, Bell proof summary, QASM preview, Git tag, and safety boundary.


## QCPU Boundary Fit Matrix

Run:

    ./scripts/qcpu_boundary_fit.sh

This creates:

    build/qcpu_boundary_fit.md

The matrix records which stones fit and which stones fall.

Expected result on normal Raspberry Pi/mobile hardware:

    EXPECTED_FAIL: PHYSICAL_QCPU_NOT_FOUND
    PASS: VIRTUAL_QCPU_READY

This is honest boundary testing, not fake physical quantum hardware claiming.


## QCPU Noise Injection Matrix

Run:

    ./scripts/qcpu_noise_injection.sh

This creates:

    build/qcpu_noise_injection.md

The test confirms that clean Bell proof passes while a synthetic noisy Bell sample is detected honestly.

    ./scripts/qcpu_recovery_matrix.sh

This creates:

    build/qcpu_recovery_matrix.md

The test detects synthetic noise, enters recovery mode, re-runs clean Bell proof, reboots the virtual QCPU, and confirms that the core engine was not mutated.

Expected:

    PASS: NOISE_DETECTED
    PASS: RECOVERY_MODE_ACTIVE
    PASS: CLEAN_BELL_PROOF_AFTER_RECOVERY
    PASS: VIRTUAL_QCPU_REBOOTED

Run:

    ./scripts/qcpu_fault_memory.sh

This creates:

    logs/qcpu_fault_memory.log
    build/qcpu_fault_memory.md

The test records a local proof trail after noise detection and recovery.

Expected:

    QCPU FAULT MEMORY READY
    PASS: CORE_NOT_MUTATED_BY_FAULT_MEMORY


## QCPU Fault Timeline

Run:

    ./scripts/qcpu_fault_timeline.sh

This creates:

    build/qcpu_fault_timeline.md

The timeline summarizes local fault memory events into a readable proof history.

Expected:

    QCPU FAULT TIMELINE READY
    PASS: CORE_NOT_MUTATED_BY_FAULT_TIMELINE

```

## QCPU CI Evidence Gate

v3.7 adds a CI evidence gate.

It checks the v3.6 CI Evidence Reporter output and opens only when CI-safe fallback, virtual QCPU support, honest physical QCPU expected-fail, core safety, and non-destructive boundary markers are present.

```text
QCPU CI EVIDENCE GATE READY
PASS: CI_EVIDENCE_GATE_OPENED
```

## QCPU Release Readiness Seal

v3.8 adds a release readiness seal.

It checks that the CI Evidence Gate is open, the virtual QCPU path is supported, the physical QCPU boundary remains honest, and the release chain is safe before allowing the release seal.

Expected output:

QCPU RELEASE READINESS SEAL READY
